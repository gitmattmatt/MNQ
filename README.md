# Matt 'n' Quynn's collaboritive project

This is the repository that Matt and Quynn can colloborate on like minded projects.
The idea is to have a place where we can go to work on ideas and develop tools.
The structure of the way Github works is important for developers of all sorts.
When code is created, changed, added to, or edited we can work together as a team to continually improve it.
Whether we have thought of something new we want to create or just want to contribute by participating just login and do it!

OK we should establish protocols and follow them until they don't suit us and then change them.
  1: Login in to this project (MNQ) and view the master readme file (this one) and follow protocol
(If better way to flow is discovered we suggest changes to the protocol in a branch off the master)
  2: If we have new stuff to create or add just go right to the branch and start working otherwise
  start to look at pull requests and approve/edit/comment/merge stuff. 
  3: (Describe the workflow of other disciplines here)
