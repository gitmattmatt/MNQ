# Matt 'n' Quynn's collaboritive project<BR>

This is the repository that Matt and Quynn can collaborate on like minded projects.<BR>
The idea is to have a place where we can go to work on ideas and develop tools.<BR>
The structure of the way Github works is important for developers of all sorts.<BR>
When code is created, changed, added to, or edited we can work together as a team to continually improve it.<BR>
Whether we have thought of something new we want to create or just want to contribute by participating just login and do it!<BR>
<BR>
OK we should establish protocols and follow them until they don't suit us and then change them.<BR>
  1: Login in to this project (MNQ) and view the master readme file (this one) and follow protocol<BR>
(If better way to flow is discovered we suggest changes to the protocol in a branch off the master)<BR>
  2: If we have new stuff to create or add just go right to the branch and start working otherwise<BR>
  start to look at pull requests and approve/edit/comment/merge stuff. <BR>
  3: (Describe the workflow of other disciplines here) <BR>
